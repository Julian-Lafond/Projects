In this program, I used a dictionary ADT containing a string key and int value to display a binary search tree in different order traversals

Dictionary.cpp - Contains a Dictionary ADT based on a binary search tree 
Dictionary.h - Header files for Dictionary.cpp
DictionaryTest.cpp - Testing for Dictionary ADT
Order.cpp - Client for Dictionary.cpp which puts key in alphabetical order and uses a pre order tree walk
Makefile - runs and builds program
