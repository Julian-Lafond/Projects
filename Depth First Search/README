In this program, a graph was built to implement the Depth First Search algorithm.  The graph was then used to find the strongly connected components 
of a digraph


List.h - header files for all functions used in List.c
List.c - contains a doubly linked list implementation with a cursor to traverse through the list 
Graph.c - Graph ADT which adds edges and runs Depth First Search
Graph.h - header files for all functions used in Graph.c
FindComponents.c - Reads from input file, adds edges, and determines the strongly connected components in topologically sorted order.
Makefile - runs and builds the program 
GraphTest.c - Testing for Graph ADTs

To run the program

./FindComponents
